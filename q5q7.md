The last 3 tests require setting up & utilizing Open Source TFS & OTC, this is part of the trial itself to confirm your ability to setup a local environment and basic navigation of Github.

Here you can find the base for TFS & OTC
https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver - Please use the 1.4 Release of TFS for the trial
https://github.com/edubart/otclient

Here you can find some guides to help you

Please reproduce the following 3 examples in a clean manner with comments as to why you programmed it the way you did. Please make sure to pay special attention to Question 6 video, we are wanting replication of the shaders in this ability (You can skip this question, as it is a more complex one, but its a big bonus if you manage to complete). Additionally please make sure to send videos of reproduction as well as the source code cleanly in their own files and open a Git Repo (public) with the edits/additions/videos made. Also, make sure to add separated commits for these questions. Q1~Q4 can be a single commit, but Q5~Q7 should be separated.



q5

I tried to reproduce the pattern and the delay of the tornado animations. 
I changed the file forgottenserver/data/spells/scripts/attack/eternal_winter.lua to modify the area of the spell eternal winter (not exact match, I know).
Then, I changed the otclient/src/client/effect.h and effect.cpp to add a way to set delays for the animation to start.
To test, I set the delays in protocolgameparse.cpp.
I haven't reproduced the exact pattern of the video sadly.

q6
Didn't have time to finish.

q7
To get the window to appear, I added a new module in otclient/modules, called game_jump. There are 3 files, jump.otmod, jump.otui, and jump.lua.
jump.otui defines the window and the button to click, and jump.lua setups the onclick listener, which calls a function on C++ side called setMoveToX.
UIWidget::setMoveToX(int x) records the value of x, and every frame in drawSelf() we gradually increase margin right towards that value.
These changes are in otclient\src\framework\ui\uiwidget.cpp.
The new function needs to be bound to Lua in otclient\src\framework\luafunctions.cpp
I have not found a solution that strictly happens on the Lua side, therefore the need to change the C++ project.
