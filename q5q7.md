I tried to reproduce the pattern and the delay of the tornado animations. 
I changed the file forgottenserver/data/spells/scripts/attack/eternal_winter.lua to modify the area of the spell eternal winter (not exact match, I know).
Then, I changed the otclient/src/client/effect.h and effect.cpp to add a way to set delays for the animation to start.
To test, I set the delays in protocolgameparse.cpp.
I haven't reproduced the exact pattern of the video sadly.

Didn't have time to finish.

q7
To get the window to appear, I added a new module in otclient/modules, called game_jump. There are 3 files, jump.otmod, jump.otui, and jump.lua.
jump.otui defines the window and the button to click, and jump.lua setups the onclick listener, which calls a function on C++ side called setMoveToX.
UIWidget::setMoveToX(int x) records the value of x, and every frame in drawSelf() we gradually increase margin right towards that value.
These changes are in otclient\src\framework\ui\uiwidget.cpp.
The new function needs to be bound to Lua in otclient\src\framework\luafunctions.cpp
I have not found a solution that strictly happens on the Lua side, therefore the need to change the C++ project.
